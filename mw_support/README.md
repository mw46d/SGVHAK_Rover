# Some supporting files

I use these little scripts to start the SGVHAK Rover server. I usually keep the two
directories at the $HOME level. But I wanted to add them somewhere to a repository. 
Feel free to modify as needed

* bin/* should end up as $HOME/bin/* mw_start starts the flask server with the
  required parameters, mw_autostart is invoked from the /etc/rc.local to start things
  on system startup.
* mw/* little Python scripts drive some displays.
